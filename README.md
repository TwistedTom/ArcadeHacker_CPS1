This fork of ArcadeHacker_CPS1 provides keys for configuring the Capcom CPS-B-21 chip to mimic the older CPS-B-xx chips.

This is useful for swapping c boards when repairing or diagnosing faults.

Known chips are: CPS-B-01/02/03/04/05/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18.

The C board must be in it's original with-battery state which means un-modding it if it's been "desuicided".

Current status: keys for all known chips are tested and work ok.

Keys are also provided and tested for 01 and 21 (no battery) configurations, but of course there is no practical use for
these as they both match the no-battery default values of the chip!

Testing was done with Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Magic Sword and Carrier Air Wing. (Variants of these games cover all known Bxx chips)
Please report any issues with games other than the above.

Known issues: the initial self-test screen colour palette is wrong for most games, sometimes making it invisible.
